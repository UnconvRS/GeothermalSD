This repository contains all the codes needed to reproduce the results presented in our recent paper- "Rashid, H. U., Olorode, O. Use of controlled fractures in enhanced geothermal systems. Advances in Geo-Energy Research, 2024, 12(1): 35-51. https://doi.org/10.46690/ager.2024.04.04". This paper is available via open access.

The simulations performed using these codes are based on the "geothermal" and "upr" modules in the MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST), which is freely available at [mrst.no](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/)

Please submit an issue if you have any problems running this code.
